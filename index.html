       <h1 id="title">The Conversation Piece</h1>
       <p id="karpova"> by Sasha Karpova</p>
    <p id="discription"> This photobook is a collection of a couple of my favourite
      poems that inspiered me to go out and take some photographs.
      As this piece is very personal to me I anotate the poems to start a conversation with reader.
      For the cover and some of the pages I reused books and magazines that I owned
      in a way giving new life to these pieses that I no longer use.
      I have digitalized 2 of the series for this website. </p>

  <h2 id="tissue">Tissue</h2>
  <h3 id="Dharker">by Imtiaz Dharker</h3>
  <p id="poem1">
Paper that lets the  <br>
shine through, this <br>
is what could alter things. <br>
Paper thinned by age or touching, <br>
<br><br>
the kind you find in well-used books,<br>
the back of the Koran, where a hand<br>
has written in the names and histories,<br>
who was born to whom,<br>
<br><br>
the height and weight, who<br>
died where and how, on which sepia date,<br>
pages smoothed and stroked and turned<br>
transparent with attention.<br>

If buildings were paper, I might<br>
feel their drift, see how easily<br>
they fall away on a sigh, a shift<br>
in the direction of the wind.<br>
<br><br>
Maps too. The sun shines through<br>
their borderlines, the marks<br>
that rivers make, roads,<br>
railtracks, mountainfolds,<br>
<br><br>
Fine slips from grocery shops<br>
that say how much was sold<br>
and what was paid by credit card<br>
might fly our lives like paper kites.<br>
<br><br>
An architect could use all this,<br>
place layer over layer, luminous<br>
script over numbers over line,<br>
and never wish to build again with brick<br>
<br><br>
or block, but let the daylight break<br>
through capitals and monoliths,<br>
through the shapes that pride can make,<br>
find a way to trace a grand design<br>
<br><br>
with living tissue, raise a structure<br>
never meant to last,<br>
of paper smoothed and stroked<br>
and thinned to be transparent,<br>
<br><br>
turned into your skin.</p>

  <h2 id="if">If</h2>
  <h3 id="Kipling">by Rudyard Kipling</h3>
  <p id="poem1">
    If you can keep your head when all about you <br>
      Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, <br>
  If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br>
      But make allowance for their doubting too; <br>
  If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br>
      Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,<br>
  Or being hated, don't give way to hating,<br>
      And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:<br>
  <br><br>
  If you can dream-and not make dreams your master;   <br>
      If you can think-and not make thoughts your aim; <br>
  If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br>
      And treat those two impostors just the same;   <br>
  If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken<br>
      Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br>
  Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br>
      And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:<br>
  <br><br>
  If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br>
      And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br>
  And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br>
      And never breathe a word about your loss;<br>
  If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br>
      To serve your turn long after they are gone, <br>
  And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br>
      Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'<br>
  <br><br>
  If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,   <br>
      Or walk with Kings-nor lose the common touch,<br>
  If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br>
      If all men count with you, but none too much;<br>
  If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br>
      With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,   <br>
  Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it, <br>
      And-which is more-you'll be a Man, my son!<br>
